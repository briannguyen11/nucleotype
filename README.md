A Terminal-Based Typing Test Emulator using the STM32 Microcontroller

The designed device is a typing speed test that that measures a userâ€™s typing speed and accuracy. The device allows you to select between three different timing selections: 10, 15, and 30 seconds. This sets the amount of type you can spend typing before time is up In each case, a series of 50 words is generated to be typed by the user within the selected time period. The timer starts as soon as the user starts typing the first word and an LCD display updates every second to let the user know how much time they have left to type. When time is up, a buzzer goes off to notify the user that they can no longer type. The user then loses the ability to type into the terminal. Finally, results in the form of typing speed in words per minute and accuracy of typed words are displayed for the user. The inspiration for this project comes from the popular typing test website Monkeytype, which also lets you select time modes and tells you your typing speed and accuracy at the end of each test.
